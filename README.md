# Panorandom

picks a random panorama from all resourcepacks to be displayed, instead of just the topmost one

a single resourcepack may also have multiple panoramas, the mod will use any complete set of `minecraft/textures/gui/title/background/[name]_[0-5].png`

this means you could have files named `.../background/nether_0.png`, `.../background/nether_1.png` etc, or you could put them into a subfolder, so its `".../background/nether/panorama_0.png` etc - as long as all numbers 0 to 5 are there it will count
